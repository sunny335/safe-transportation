<h1 align="center">Project Boilerplate for React Redux-toolkit Bootstrap & React router dom</h1>

## Installing:

To get the app installing locally:

- Clone this repo

Given command
`yarn install` or `npm install`
from the root to install all required dependencies.

## Env setup:

Create a `.env` file on the project root and copy the variables from `.env.example`

## Start dev server:

`yarn dev` or `npm dev`

## Check Linting

`yarn run lint` or `npm run lint`

You will most likely see some errors. You can fix some of these errors by simply re-running the same command with the â€”-fix option. I would recommend not using the fix option until you have had a chance to look at the code that is causing the errors. That will give you a better understanding of why you are seeing the errors. Also, you may need to adjust some of the rules based on your preferences.
